### Klaudia's Space: Old Portfolio

This repository contains my old personal portfolio website, which I created in 2019/2020 to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. Although the external links are no longer functional, this project represents an important step in my journey.

### Overview

"Klaudia's Space" was designed to be simple place where I could share my work and connect with potential collaborators or employers. The portfolio included sections for my bio, skills, projects, and contact information.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes animations and hover effects to enhance user experience.
- **Custom Styling:** Extensive use of CSS and SCSS for styling and layout, including use of CSS pop-ups.

### Note

Please note that the external links to my projects (as well as other external links) are no longer active. This portfolio serves primarily as a historical record of my work at that time.
